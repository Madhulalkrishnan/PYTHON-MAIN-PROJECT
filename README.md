# PYTHON-MAIN-PROJECT
Employee Data Analysis Project  Overview  This project involves analyzing a dataset provided by ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The aim is to preprocess the data, perform various analyses, and visually represent the findings, culminating in actionable insights for the organization.
Preprocessing Steps

#Data Cleaning:

Replaced inconsistent values in the "height" column with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data integrity.

Handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate measures (mean/median/mode) based on the column's data type.

Removed duplicate rows to avoid redundancy.

#Feature Engineering:

Encoded categorical variables for compatibility with analysis and visualization.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize data for analysis.

#Outlier Detection:

Identified and treated outliers in key columns (e.g., age, salary) using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

#Analysis Tasks

##Team Distribution:

Calculated the number of employees in each team and their percentage relative to the total workforce.

#Position Segregation:

Grouped employees by their positions, highlighting the distribution of roles within the organization.

#Age Group Analysis:

Identified the predominant age group among employees to understand workforce demographics.

#Salary Expenditure by Team and Position:

Analyzed salary data to determine which team and position incurred the highest salary expenditure.

#Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Investigated potential correlations between age and salary to understand how compensation aligns with experience.

#Graphical Representations

For each analysis task, appropriate visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Team Distribution: Bar charts displaying the number and percentage of employees in each team.

Position Segregation: Pie charts illustrating the distribution of roles.

Age Group Analysis: Histograms showing the frequency of different age groups.

Salary Expenditure: Heatmaps and bar charts highlighting teams and positions with the highest salary costs.

Age vs. Salary Correlation: Scatter plots visualizing the relationship between age and salary.

#Insights Gained

Teams with the largest workforce were identified, providing insights into resource allocation.

Predominant positions within the company highlighted operational priorities.

The most common age group revealed the demographic focus of the workforce.

High salary expenditure in specific teams and positions prompted recommendations for budgeting strategies.

Positive correlation between age and salary suggested compensation aligned with experience, with some exceptions indicating rapid career progression in certain roles.
